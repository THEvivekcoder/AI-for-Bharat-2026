# BharatSaathi 🇮🇳
**Empowering Rural Bharat through Voice-First AI**

Developed by Team **Algorangers** for the **AI for Bharat 2026** Initiative.

## 🚀 Overview
BharatSaathi is an AI-powered digital companion designed to solve the accessibility gap for 250M+ rural users. By combining **Bhashini's** multilingual speech capabilities with **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, we provide a safe, hallucination-free way for users to discover government schemes, local jobs, and educational resources—entirely through voice.

## 🛠️ Key Features
- **Dialect-Aware Voice Interaction:** Direct communication in 22+ Indian languages.
- **Verified Knowledge Base:** Information is fetched only from trusted public domains (MyScheme, NCS).
- **Inclusion-Centric UI:** Zero-text interface optimized for low-literacy users.
- **Responsible Design:** Built-in guardrails to prevent misinformation and bias.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `requirements.md`: Detailed project scope, user stories, and functional goals.
- `design.md`: Technical architecture, AI pipeline details, and technology stack.

## 🤖 Why AI?
Unlike traditional apps, BharatSaathi uses Generative AI to understand the *intent* behind diverse local dialects, transforming complex bureaucratic language into simple, actionable voice guidance.
